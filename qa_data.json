We could relate to it on a deep level, from both our social backgrounds and having lost her grandmother to Alzheimer\u2019s. \n\nThe characters and story always felt familiar, though I didn\u2019t see the parallels that would come to be. \nI did not meet the societal standard for her higher class and religious southern family, and our social circles clashed in a major way. But we were an instant attraction and inseparable. Almost immediately we had formed a bond that hit hard and deep. And unfortunately one I\u2019ve never been able to fully separate from, that I have carried with me ever since, and know I will the rest of my life. \n\nOur relationship ended through misunderstanding,  unfortunate circumstance, and outside interference by friends and family (think \u201cintercepted / manipulated messages\u201d). \n\nAs a result, the relationship ended suddenly and under false premises. That year was an especially painful time for me, and her, as we each were supported by our respective social circles and tried to recover from what felt like heartbreak and betrayal. \n\nI wrote her letters she never received (I found out later they were intercepted), and I waited. Her life continued without knowing, and mine continued not knowing how she felt, or if she knew I was still here. \n\nEventually we both moved our lives forward individually. As is tradition here, we each married other people in our young twenties, in extravagant social affairs, had several children, and settled into suburban southern life. She married the family friend she had always been encouraged to by friends and family, and I did the similar. We each matched well, and the unions were met with approval by all. \n\nIndividually we accomplished the personal goals we had made together. We built the lives we had always planned on and promised each other, but with someone else. \n\nOver the years I\u2019ve found out updates that have been difficult to bear, and reopened old wounds. The hardest being we both told friends we still had feelings for the other, but each thought the other had moved on, and we had little choice but to try to as well.\n\nIt has only been in the last year that I became reacquainted with the film, and upon a rewatch felt like I was seeing our life play out in real time. Just too many parallels to be able to make it through the film this time. \n\n**\nThrough bizarre circumstance , I now live where the book \u201cThe Notebook\u201d was written, discovering the author\u2019s house at the time is on my block. Our neighborhood pond and the geese I watch every morning are in fact, the same he gazed upon while writing his novel. \n\nPretty hard to live with that one. \n\nTL;DR - lived out the film, and now live in the same neighborhood.

While the other children went back to playing, I thought it was dangerous to leave the baby alone, so I hung back and talked to it, made funny faces, and *gently* caressed its little tuft of hair. The baby was giggling all along, when suddenly its mother burst out the door and started berating me at the top of her lungs. I don't remember the exact words, but it boiled down to it being dangerous to touch a baby's head, and that I could've **KILLED** it. My classmate's parents eventually came running and got her off my back. I know what she was referring to, the bones in a baby's head aren't fully fused yet, but I wasn't poking at it or anything rough, and she was probably drunk, what with a glass of wine in one hand and a cigarette in the other, and forgetting her baby outside, but this shit SCARED me to the point I legitimately thought I was dangerous to small children. This only changed when I was in my 30s and my new neighbours' 5-year-old son decided I was his friend, and thus I got to interact with his baby sister, too. Which is how I came to realise that I absolutely love children. They're egotistical little snotgoblins, and they're awesome.\n* My sister's obsession with having children was a serious turn-off.

She *finally* had her son at age 43, and fortunately he's healthy. \n* Despite my fear of hurting small children, I still considered it an option, but only if I had a partner who was willing to take on this task with me.

Those small actions might then ripple out into transforming communities and healing divides, ushering in a future where cooperation and love win over hate and conflict.\n\nBut that's not a mere daydream; this is stuff that we, together, can make real. This is that time. You have that power within. It starts with the person next to you. The world will change when we as individuals begin to lead with our hearts.

The next play in the collection was *Catiline His Conspiracy*, and I thought it would be more interesting \u2013 since Jonson's classical tragedies have the reputation of being a bit starchy and dull \u2013 if I had the background direct from the source (I've also read Cicero's Catilinarian orations). However, I think the reputation may be a little unfair based on what I read of *Sejanus His Fall*. It was talky, but I think the British and U. S. *House of Cards* series have prepared us for talky political dramas featuring Machiavellian characters, and that a well-directed production could be very good. So I'm cautiously optimistic with *Catiline*. This is part of a two-volume series that has all of the complete or nearly complete public theatre plays of Ben Jonson in chronological order (only omitting the fragment of *Mortimer His Fall*). The one exception to the chronological arrangement is *The Case is Altered*, since it was one of the last printed even though it was written c. 1598, and the book follows the date of the printing instead of the likely date of composition.\n\nAnd since I'll probably be listening to *Modern Times* on KUSC (a program of 20th/21st century classical music) later tonight, I'll probably be reading either the anthology *The Basic Kafka* introduced by Erich Heller (I'm currently up to \"Josephine and the Mouse Folk\") or *Foucault's Pendulum* by Umberto Eco.

", "Music with odd time signatures instinctively give a feeling of lulling or \"floating in air\", a kind of incompleteness (that I really like, personally). I find most songs in 3/4 (waltz time) or 6/8 extremely pleasurable, almost to the point of where you can't go wrong with it note wise (even atonal music in 3/4 time is sometimes listenable). Music in 5/4, 7/8, 9/8 etc. are great for enhancing i.e. hypnotic and philosophical themes that are inherently unsettled. Also, the extra beat, or the removal of one, can be used for effect to bring home a rhythmic point, catching the listener off guard and forcing attention to a particular part of the song. Progressive rock bands like Rush, Tool and Dream Theater use these a LOT.\n\nMost music is in 4/4 because people in general unconsciously gravitate towards rhythmic simplicity and a sense of \"grounding\". It's also easy to dance to. People like dancing, and not a lot of people dance waltz anymore, much less 7/8 or 9/8.\n\nNow, the genius thing is to make things like time signature changes catchy. The song \"Freewill\" by Rush accomplishes this perfectly I think. The intro is a mix of 6/4 and 7/4 (13/8), while other parts are in straight 7/4 or 5/4, and they fit seemlessly together."], ["How come most modern-day music is done in 4/4 or 2/4 time, and not 3/4 or other timings?
