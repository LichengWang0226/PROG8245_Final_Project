But so I could have a different history with it, maybe never see it. \n\n(TL;DR at the bottom with the interesting bit)\n\nLike so many people, this movie was one of me and my ex\u2019s \u201cmovies\u201d. We could relate to it on a deep level, from both our social backgrounds and having lost her grandmother to Alzheimer\u2019s. \n\nThe characters and story always felt familiar, though I didn\u2019t see the parallels that would come to be. \nI did not meet the societal standard for her higher class and religious southern family, and our social circles clashed in a major way. But we were an instant attraction and inseparable. Almost immediately we had formed a bond that hit hard and deep. And unfortunately one I\u2019ve never been able to fully separate from, that I have carried with me ever since, and know I will the rest of my life. \n\nOur relationship ended through misunderstanding,  unfortunate circumstance, and outside interference by friends and family (think \u201cintercepted / manipulated messages\u201d). \n\nAs a result, the relationship ended suddenly and under false premises. That year was an especially painful time for me, and her, as we each were supported by our respective social circles and tried to recover from what felt like heartbreak and betrayal. \n\nI wrote her letters she never received (I found out later they were intercepted), and I waited. Her life continued without knowing, and mine continued not knowing how she felt, or if she knew I was still here. \n\nEventually we both moved our lives forward individually. As is tradition here, we each married other people in our young twenties, in extravagant social affairs, had several children, and settled into suburban southern life. She married the family friend she had always been encouraged to by friends and family, and I did the similar. We each matched well, and the unions were met with approval by all. \n\nIndividually we accomplished the personal goals we had made together. We built the lives we had always planned on and promised each other, but with someone else. \n\nOver the years I\u2019ve found out updates that have been difficult to bear, and reopened old wounds. The hardest being we both told friends we still had feelings for the other, but each thought the other had moved on, and we had little choice but to try to as well.\n\nIt has only been in the last year that I became reacquainted with the film, and upon a rewatch felt like I was seeing our life play out in real time. Just too many parallels to be able to make it through the film this time. \n\n**\nThrough bizarre circumstance , I now live where the book \u201cThe Notebook\u201d was written, discovering the author\u2019s house at the time is on my block. Our neighborhood pond and the geese I watch every morning are in fact, the same he gazed upon while writing his novel. \n\nPretty hard to live with that one. \n\nTL;DR - lived out the film, and now live in the same neighborhood.

We really didn't have much to do, like everyone else, the wife is a nurse, so she was working basically part time because she's surgical, and no surgeries were happening outside of emergencies, we were looking at our finances, and realized we were being stupid and had most of our money just sitting in savings not working for us, so we started researching lots of different investments and what sticks we might like to get into (we had a very small portfolio nothing to write home about) so we each picked a few stocks and dumped a good portion of our savings i to them, this is when Covid was in full force, and the DJI was down around 18-19k today it's at almost 40k \n\nAnd last, i was a little into cryptomining, had built a 7 video card Etherium miner that i ran for about a year or so, but during that hype, video cards were super expensive, and hard to come by because everyone was building miners, nvidia announced they were going to produce a crypto mining card, so i figured why not double down and get some Nvidia stock......... i bought a bunch because at the time it was only like $40 a share, and of course it went to over $1000 and then split 10:1.\n\nI'm certainly no financial guru, but I've gotten lucky a few times."], ["What\u2019s the most realistic way someone who doesn\u2019t come from money becomes wealthy?", "Savings and wise investments"], ["What\u2019s the most realistic way someone who doesn\u2019t come from money becomes wealthy?", "Choosing a job that pays well and then being smart with money earned. \n\nAs in - saving and investing smartly, it could be stock market or real estate, relatively simple things to do for an average person."], ["What\u2019s the most realistic way someone who doesn\u2019t come from money becomes wealthy?", "Aquire education.

Then when the stress of my family and job situation started stressing me to no tomorrow, giving me physical pain as well as the mental part (my dad had to go to a nursing home due to dementia quickening his decline, my mom getting massacred by the nursing home financially, and then my younger brother's new wife doing all the mental bashing she could to try to force me to give my met career and move back from Minnesota to a depressed part of PA), I ended up losing my job due to the combined stress just being too much which led to a decline in performance, which led her to leaving me 2 weeks later. \n\never since, I have to admit, confidence in myself to have anything more than a close friendship with people, especially ladies, just never totally came back in the last 10+ years. I love my nieces and nephews like no tomorrow back in eastern PA. so much so that I admit to being a bit protective of my niece from afar, not wanting others to shoot down her dreams and ambitions like i feared her mom (my younger brother's first wife, who cheated on him while he was in Iraq with the PA National Guard) might do. just like my dad was trying to do before he died from his dementia. \n\nbut i just never could get in a close enough relationship to even think about kids of my own."], ["What\u2019s your reason for not having kids?

While the other children went back to playing, I thought it was dangerous to leave the baby alone, so I hung back and talked to it, made funny faces, and *gently* caressed its little tuft of hair. The baby was giggling all along, when suddenly its mother burst out the door and started berating me at the top of her lungs. I don't remember the exact words, but it boiled down to it being dangerous to touch a baby's head, and that I could've **KILLED** it. My classmate's parents eventually came running and got her off my back. I know what she was referring to, the bones in a baby's head aren't fully fused yet, but I wasn't poking at it or anything rough, and she was probably drunk, what with a glass of wine in one hand and a cigarette in the other, and forgetting her baby outside, but this shit SCARED me to the point I legitimately thought I was dangerous to small children. This only changed when I was in my 30s and my new neighbours' 5-year-old son decided I was his friend, and thus I got to interact with his baby sister, too. Which is how I came to realise that I absolutely love children. They're egotistical little snotgoblins, and they're awesome.\n* My sister's obsession with having children was a serious turn-off. It was the same song all along, \"I want a child before I'm 25\", \"I want a child before I'm 30\", \"I want a child before I'm 35\", \"I want a child before I'm 40\", all the while dating men that obviously had ZERO interest in starting a family. She *finally* had her son at age 43, and fortunately he's healthy. \n* Despite my fear of hurting small children, I still considered it an option, but only if I had a partner who was willing to take on this task with me.

The next play in the collection was *Catiline His Conspiracy*, and I thought it would be more interesting \u2013 since Jonson's classical tragedies have the reputation of being a bit starchy and dull \u2013 if I had the background direct from the source (I've also read Cicero's Catilinarian orations). However, I think the reputation may be a little unfair based on what I read of *Sejanus His Fall*. It was talky, but I think the British and U. S. *House of Cards* series have prepared us for talky political dramas featuring Machiavellian characters, and that a well-directed production could be very good. So I'm cautiously optimistic with *Catiline*. This is part of a two-volume series that has all of the complete or nearly complete public theatre plays of Ben Jonson in chronological order (only omitting the fragment of *Mortimer His Fall*). The one exception to the chronological arrangement is *The Case is Altered*, since it was one of the last printed even though it was written c. 1598, and the book follows the date of the printing instead of the likely date of composition.\n\nAnd since I'll probably be listening to *Modern Times* on KUSC (a program of 20th/21st century classical music) later tonight, I'll probably be reading either the anthology *The Basic Kafka* introduced by Erich Heller (I'm currently up to \"Josephine and the Mouse Folk\") or *Foucault's Pendulum* by Umberto Eco.

", "Music with odd time signatures instinctively give a feeling of lulling or \"floating in air\", a kind of incompleteness (that I really like, personally). I find most songs in 3/4 (waltz time) or 6/8 extremely pleasurable, almost to the point of where you can't go wrong with it note wise (even atonal music in 3/4 time is sometimes listenable). Music in 5/4, 7/8, 9/8 etc. are great for enhancing i.e. hypnotic and philosophical themes that are inherently unsettled. Also, the extra beat, or the removal of one, can be used for effect to bring home a rhythmic point, catching the listener off guard and forcing attention to a particular part of the song. Progressive rock bands like Rush, Tool and Dream Theater use these a LOT.\n\nMost music is in 4/4 because people in general unconsciously gravitate towards rhythmic simplicity and a sense of \"grounding\". It's also easy to dance to. People like dancing, and not a lot of people dance waltz anymore, much less 7/8 or 9/8.\n\nNow, the genius thing is to make things like time signature changes catchy. The song \"Freewill\" by Rush accomplishes this perfectly I think. The intro is a mix of 6/4 and 7/4 (13/8), while other parts are in straight 7/4 or 5/4, and they fit seemlessly together."], ["At what age did you find yourself most attractive?", "Let me tell you something, I haven't even begun to peak.

My dad who I haven't seen in person for 5 years, decided to move to my state and was suddenly back in my life. Meanwhile, my mom and I had a fallout because of my step-dad, and she moved out of my grandma's with him. This left 16 year old me, and my 80 something year old grandma on our own without a car.\u00a0\n\n\nThis was a weird sudden imbalance. My grandma hadn't dealt with a teenager fulltime since my uncle in the 80s. She was a second generation Italian, hailed from Brooklyn, and grew up during the great depression. She had just survived a stroke a year prior. For a 80 something year old, she was tough as hell.\n\n\nMy first semester of 10th grade started out with all of this, so I wasn't doing well mentally, but I made it work. I was a funny weird kid, and in my history class I cracked a ton of jokes in particular. Sometimes I even made the teacher laugh. Most of the other kids liked me, except for this one girl. She was preppy I guess. Not exactly popular, but Hollister conventional I guess.\n\n\nThis girl starts focusing in on me big time. She HATES me. She verbally abuses me and gets her one friend involved. One day, while dealing with all of this, I start thinking about everything that was currently going on in my life. I snap. I start crying hysterically. I had a few minutes til the bell too.\u00a0\n\n\nThis girl LOVES this. She smiles, she laughs, she exchanges looks with her friend. She triumphantly trots off.

I was heart broken she turned her back on me.\u00a0\n\n\nI cried on the bus. Two other girls who hated me turned around to laugh. I think being neurodivergent kinda made me a target for some reason with these girls.\n\n\nAnyway, here's the sweet part. I get home and my grandma opens the door to see me bawling. She's dumbfounded. She rushes me into the kitchen and hands me a bowl of gnocchi. I tell her what happened while I cry eat. She's LIVID. She told me that she was going to go down the school and tell her that we had family in the mafia. That this girl will be \"shaking in her boots\" by the time she's done. I never in my 16 years had felt this sort of protection before. It made me glad it happened. Somehow knowing I had a person at home who loved me, made me brave about all of this.\n\n\nAt any rate, the girl continually tried to bully me and the teacher did nothing.

I didn\u2019t plan on going until this girl asked me to go with her. She couldn\u2019t get a date because she wasn\u2019t great looking and she basically used me for a date and had no friendly or romantic interest in me. I knew her family, they understood no guys were asking her to go, and so they all realized that I would save their daughter the embarrassment of having no date for prom. I didn\u2019t fully realize how lame and shitty this was for me to be a part of back then but I do now.\n\nSenior prom is my first school dance ever and I naturally have no idea how to dance or have fun. The entire night wasn\u2019t memorable at all and I was basically alone and invisible. My date never showed any interest in dancing with me apart from the requisite slow dances and I never showed any interest in her because I didn\u2019t know what I was doing or how to dance or how to even conduct myself at a school dance. I basically just stood around and watched the night go by.\n\nAt some point, this hot popular girl took my hand out of nowhere and pulled me to the dance floor to grind with her. My heart rate went up, my anxiety kicked in, I felt panicky and a cold sweat broke out almost instantly since I had never, ever been in this situation before where I was grinding with a girl. At that point, I had never been kissed, never held a girl\u2019s hand, and girls didn\u2019t want anything to do with me in high school and so I didn\u2019t know how to interact with them in a sort of quasi-sexual way.\n\nIt\u2019s prom night and naturally this beautiful girl looks about as beautiful as she ever has given her hair being done, her make up looking good, and her dress looking silky and great. She starts rubbing her nice butt against my crotch to the sound of Kanye West\u2019s song \u201cStronger\u201d and within ten seconds my penis is rock hard. This is when her body jolts straight up and away from my penis and she excuses herself to get a drink without looking at me. That was the end of our dancing and that is - to this day - the most sexual contact I have ever had in my life as a virgin man.\n\nYeas later I realized that she stopped grinding on me because my boner was rubbing against her butt and this totally shocked her and creeped her out. It\u2019s semi-normal for half the guys who get grinded on to get boners but the thing is that when girls grind with guys they almost always do so because they are attracted to them and they wouldn\u2019t mind their boners rubbing against their butts. Well, this girl was not attracted to me and she only danced with me because she thought that I was kind of cool and popular due to who she thought my friends were back then. She was sort of this naive, very nice, hot and popular girl that was maybe too nice to people and that night she was too nice to me and doled out a pity grind that we both came to regret. It is cringeworthy in the extreme for me because it meant that she made a big mistake grinding with me because I\u2019m apparently ugly enough that the idea of my penis rubbing against her traumatized her and she had to flee the situation. This wouldn\u2019t have happened if she was grinding with some of the handsome guys at prom that night. It probably would have turned her on like it does for other girls when handsome guys sometimes get hard while grinding.\n\nI only understood this incident many years later after high school was over.

It was pretty cold and i realized quite late that the bus wouldn't  come as i lost the last one without knowing. It is a pretty uneventful city, very safe compared to others, so i wasn t woried at all being there alone, well probably because i lacked the paranoia of someone who has been through sexual or any kind of abuse. When i told myself that i would just simply walk in the rain till i get home that s when a drunk man appeared from behind me and started talking to me. Half of it i didn't even understand, that s how drunk he wa. I was trying to be nice and brush him off without much disrespect as i started to wonder how would a drunk man twice my size react if i told him to fuck off, well that was untill he started touching me inappropriately and i seriously started to get scared. The street i was on was in general a really circulated one, but that night there was no one. Even cars were few. I tried to get him off me but he wouldn't budge, so i started telling him nonsense about how i see my father on the other side of the road and how he was waiting there. Probably it was really obvious that i was lying, but he was really drunk and he let me go and started looking towards where i told him my \"father\" was. In that moment i started running on heels faster than i ever did in sneakers. I remember that i crossed the road and then i jumped the fence of a hotel nearby. I quietly ran through the parking lot and jumped another fence on the other side of the lot and i was back into the streets.

Its a long read so yeah TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nFor a while, whenever I went to bed I would dream that I was in a different world, the type of world that fantasy books and Dungeons and Dragons would be based on, were it real. And there I would wonder around and explore various ruins and magical forests with a few friends I made. There were normal humans of course, but there were other races you would find in Lord of the Rings and worlds like that. There was an elf I traveled with that acted as a rear guard and archer. She was beautiful, but i wouldn't describe elves as the most beautiful people to exist, more like they just have finer and more delicate features than the average human and are on average thinner and smaller because of their vegan diet. A pixie who provided logistical and magical support. They looked like they were a living plant, and not just a tiny human with wings, their skin was like bark, their fingers and toes were long and knobby and their clothing were like leaves that grew from their bodies. a wolf person that looked like what a dog-man is commonly described as, muscular with wide shoulders, thick wiry fur that covered every inch of their skin and a hatred of pants and clothing. And another human, strong and capable from years of manual labor, from that world that acted as our vanguards and various other races and monsters you can only read about.\n\nI'm willing to admit that this all may be a product of my young and over active imagination, but something about it all felt too real. I could smell the grass and vegetation, the scents my canine friend would point out to us, I could sense the temperature of the leather and metal armor I wore given to me by the human, the touch of my companion when the elf would comfort and hold me, and most important the sting of the flesh that was cut when I got injured and then the warmth from the magic my pixie friend used to fix us up as our wounds would stitch themselves back together. My friends and I would go out, adventure, and when I went to sleep there I woke up here and then next night when I slept here our adventures would continue and our connections grew even deeper.\n\nJust like it all started and one night in a dream I woke up there, one night I just as suddenly was incapable of getting back. It hurt for a while but eventually I grew up and moved on. Cant be stuck in a world of dreams, you know? And now its been so long all I remember is their faces and as sad as it is to say, I've forgotten their names, the name of the continent, and the names of creatures I interacted with. It's all just a fading memory now. I know is sounds absurd, but maybe here I'll have someone believe me, I believe I went to an actual other world/universe when I slept and was brought back here when I woke up. I talked to my parents, at the time about it, but who would seriously believe a 10/11 year old when they say they go to another world in their sleep? It's not like I was capable of bringing anything or anyone back with me.\n\nBut it lead me to form a theory that when you read stories about dragons, monsters, ghosts, and anything out of the ordinary appearing here and then never being seen again was something from that world slipping into ours and then slipping back. I'd very much like to go back and meet them all again, go back to exploring the world, and looting dungeons. Maybe even bring back an enchanted crystal or the ability to preform some simple magic I learned. I'd love for my friends to see how I've grown up and how much more I could help them now instead of the scared child I was then. But its been slightly over 20 years since I've been back, I doubt they would even recognize me and even if I did I'm sure they would be disappointed that I just disappeared without saying anything to them. and what leads me to believe I was actually going anywhere and not just dreaming was the time I had received a pretty bad cut to my arm and as I was being healed, close to completion, I passed out and when I woke up here there was a small scratch in the exact same size and location. Still have the small scar. But If I ever do fall asleep and wake up there again I promised myself I would do everything I could to figure out where I was going and try to find a way to bring something back here with me as proof if I couldn't figure out a way to remain there or travel freely between here and there.\n\nI've talked to friends about this and nobody believes me, I've been told over and over it was just a dream or I'm making things up, so I've given up on ever bringing it up to them again. I've looked for similar experiences online but usually turn up nothing like I experienced or just comics about some character dying and being reincarnated. Maybe it was just a dream, maybe I did read a book with this plot when I was young and am misremembering it, but on the off-chance I really was being taken to a different world I want to go and live there more than I do here. Something just feels like I belonged there more than I do here.\n\n  \nTo;DR \\~ For a period of about 2 years I would go to sleep and wake up in the same dream world where I had friends and interactions, got hurt and received scars, and have vivid memories of my time there that it felt real. Maybe I would go to a different world in my dreams, maybe i just had an overactive imagination, but I'm convinced I met real people and creatures from another universe."], ["What is your creepy / unknown experience that no one else believe?", "Once woke up and saw what looked like a rotting corpse standing in my room, and it wasn't sleep paralysis or anything since I was able to move and I had to get up and get ready for school... it was super creepy and I've never seen it again.

I said everyone ascended to the real world but everyone is here. This program is a time-line so they can create worlds. This world has templates for everyone so they can easily be replaced with full memory and awareness. So that makes it look like nothing ever happened. On my count the world has been emptied and me being put in a new body about 8 times now and as I am still stuck. the last world is filled with people who think they are the originals but are probably other people. when they ascend they will remember all their past lives and just pick what they find is most cool. So In short. You, Yes you too aren't originally you either. but don't worry you'll wont notice anything anyway\n\nThe beings sent to free me from the timeline plan to release me or ''free'' me as they say in about a month or two. I have been possessed since 2019 on exactly my birthday. They finally got me unstuck and planned to get the world ending in like September. They plan for me to be sent to the year 2000 again so I can actually be released at the same time as the people from the original world so the world end as they never needed to exist in the first place. as for future I for one know nothing persay. All I know is that they made me share my own body through time hijinks and thus I already lived it. This way they can kinda cheat by looking into my memories and last time which is the same as now stopped just a few days after meeting my new psychiatrist.\n\nI cannot prove this. not even with having future knowledge stuff. They already think I am crazy but day by day for the past 6 years I have been repeating the same thing I already lived through the same body. Even freakier I can hear my past self talk through my mouth. The only way I remember any of this is through these beings and they are just kinda doing this typing out of boredom.
